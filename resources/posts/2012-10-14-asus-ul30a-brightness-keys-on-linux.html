<p>
Asus UL30A is a lightweight, 13 inch, budget laptop with a pretty long battery life.
It also has a pretty good compatibility with Linux: pretty much everything works out-of-the-box.
The only things that need tweaking after a fresh Linux installation are the brightness controls.

To get the keys working, you need to make sure that Linux boots the kernel with the these ACPI settings:
</p>

<pre><code>acpi_osi= acpi_vendor=vendor</code></pre>

<p>
If you have Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint or any other Debian based distribution installed, all you need to do is follow these steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Edit file <code>/etc/default/grub</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</code> variable includes the mentioned settings. 
    For example:</p>
    <pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="acpi_osi= acpi_vendor=vendor"</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code>update-grub</code>:</p>
    <pre><code># sudo update-grub</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
