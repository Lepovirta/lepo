*Lepo* is Finnish for *rest* and *repose*.

The culture of chasing deadline after deadline at a breackneck speed is unsustainable.
Value the health of yourself and others over the goals of your projects.
Avoid burnout, and allow yourself to have a break.
*Relax*.

This site is a space for sharing and collaborating on ideas, tools, and knowledge to help software developers of all skill levels.

All Lepo related code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Lepovirta).
None of the projects have any schedules,
and they will be worked on whenever anyone feels like working on them.
