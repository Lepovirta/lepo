There are a few projects maintained under the Lepo umbrella.
Some of them are to solve niche practical problems, some are just to experiment on things, but all of them are [free and open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).
None of the projects have any schedules, and they will be worked on whenever anyone feels like working on them.
