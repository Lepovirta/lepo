# lepo

Static website generator for [Lepo](https://lepo.group/).

## Developing

This project follows a standard [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site structure.
See the Hugo documentation for more information on how to use it.

There's a couple of helper scripts to help you get started:

* `bin/serve.sh`: starts live server for Hugo
* `bin/generate.sh`: generates the full site to the `public/` directory

These scripts automatically download the correct version of Hugo to the `bin/` directory.
You can also download Hugo manually using `bin/download_hugo.sh`,
and then use `bin/hugo` directly.
